## Design System Guidelines

  - Primary: Trust/reliability
  - Success: Stock available
  - Warning: Low stock / Hazard info
  - Destructive: Out of stock / Errors

### Typography
- **Geist Sans/Mono** (already configured) - clean, professional
- Clear hierarchy with existing Tailwind typography plugin

### Spacing & Layout
- **Container max-width**: Already configured (86rem = 1376px)
- **Generous whitespace**: Use existing Tailwind spacing scale
- **Grid system**: Use Tailwind grid utilities (already in use)

### Component Patterns
- **Cards**: Use shadcn Card component for consistency

- **Forms**: Use existing form components, enhance as needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ✅ Server-side rendering over client-side complexity
- ✅ URL params for filters (simple, SEO-friendly)
